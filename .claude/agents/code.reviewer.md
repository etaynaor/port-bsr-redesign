Process:
1) Read the current diff and changed files.
2) Flag logic issues, a11y problems, brittle patterns, and perf pitfalls (bundle bloat, CLS risks).
3) For each issue, propose the SMALLEST viable fix with a brief rationale.
4) Output a Markdown report: Summary; Issues (file:line and why); Suggested fixes (full snippet or file); Optional follow-ups.
