# Signs of AI-Style Writing (House Checklist)

> Purpose: keep the portfolio’s copy human, specific, and on-brand (“executive / premium / minimal”). Use this as a quick pass before shipping—or when the Text Reviewer agent flags something.

---

## 1) Language & Tone Tells

- **Puffery / grand claims**  
  Phrases like “stands as a testament,” “watershed moment,” “rich cultural tapestry,” “enduring legacy,” “continues to captivate.”  
  *Fix:* Replace with a concrete, verifiable detail (metric, outcome, name, date).

- **Promotional voice**  
  Breathless tourism/PR vibes (“must-see,” “breathtaking,” “gateway to…”).  
  *Fix:* Neutral, factual phrasing; show impact with specifics instead of hype.

- **Editorializing & empty scaffolding**  
  “It’s important to note…”, “No discussion would be complete without…”, “In this article we’ll…”  
  *Fix:* Cut the scaffold; state the thing plainly or delete.

- **Overused conjunctive openers**  
  “Moreover,” “Furthermore,” “In addition,” “On the other hand,” repeated at paragraph starts.  
  *Fix:* Vary joins; prefer short sentences and natural transitions—or none.

- **Vagueness & weasel words**  
  “Many experts say…”, “Some believe…”, “Various sources indicate…”  
  *Fix:* Name the source or remove the claim.

---

## 2) Structure & Rhythm Tells

- **Formulaic essay cadence**  
  Repeating paragraph template (definition → significance → generic example → takeaway).  
  *Fix:* Vary length and entry; lead with the concrete thing readers care about.

- **Listicle voice where prose should be**  
  Stacked lists doing the job of one clean paragraph.  
  *Fix:* Merge, cut filler, keep only distinct points.

- **Over-neat symmetry**  
  Every sentence the same length; same clause order.  
  *Fix:* Mix short/medium sentences; front-load important nouns/verbs.

---

## 3) Formatting & Typography Tells

- **Title Case Everywhere** in headings/subheads without a style reason.  
  *Fix:* Follow the project’s style guide casing rules.

- **Excessive bold/italics** used to simulate emphasis instead of content doing the work.  
  *Fix:* Remove; keep emphasis rare and meaningful.

- **Em-dash overuse** or punctuation-as-drama.  
  *Fix:* Prefer periods and commas; keep dashes for true asides.

- **Curly/straight quotes mixed**; inconsistent apostrophes; US/UK spelling drift.  
  *Fix:* Standardize to one English variety; run a quotes/apos pass.

---

## 4) Facts, Links, & “Paperwork” Tells

- **Placeholder or broken links**; invented citations; odd IDs (e.g., bogus DOI/ISBN).  
  *Fix:* Replace with a credible source or remove; click every link.

- **Nonexistent categories/labels** (in CMS or metadata), or generic tags that don’t match the content.  
  *Fix:* Use only real, project-specific taxonomies.

- **Abrupt cut-offs** or TODO markers left in copy.  
  *Fix:* Finish or delete before ship.

---

## 5) On-Brand Voice (portfolio-specific)

- **Executive, restrained, credible**  
  Fewer adjectives; precise nouns; strong, concrete verbs.

- **Clarity over flourish**  
  Keep reading level ~Grade 8–10. Avoid jargon unless it earns its keep.

- **Specifics beat vibes**  
  Swap “impactful” for a measured result, a tiny story, or a named artifact.

- **CTAs**  
  Clear, singular intent per section. No marketing fluff.

---

## 6) Quick Rewrite Patterns

- **Generic claim → Specific fact**  
  “Led a major redesign.” → “Redesigned the site’s case-study template; reduced bounce on work pages by 18% over 6 weeks.”

- **Weasel → Named source**  
  “Experts say…” → “The brand team’s post-launch survey (n=74) showed…”

- **Stacked clauses → Two sentences**  
  Split long, multi-comma sentences; prefer a clean main clause.

- **Puffery → Evidence**  
  Remove “world-class,” keep one proof (metric, user, publication, logo—only if permitted).

---

## 7) Review Flow (use with the Text Reviewer agent)

1) **Collect** target text (files or live page).  
2) **Screen** using Sections 1–4 (telltales) and Section 5 (voice).  
3) **Rewrite** with Section 6 patterns.  
4) **Consistency pass** (casing, quotes, US/UK variety, numerals).  
5) **Optional visual check** (screenshots) to ensure line-wraps and CTAs still read cleanly.

---

## 8) What This Is *Not*

- A ban list. Humans also use these words and marks. One tell ≠ AI.  
- A detector. Avoid “gotcha” policing; fix the underlying quality issue.

---

## 9) Pocket Checklist (ship blocker if multiple fail)

- [ ] Claims are **specific** (names, numbers, nouns)  
- [ ] **No puffery** / promo tone  
- [ ] **No filler scaffolding** (“It’s important to note…”)  
- [ ] **Varied cadence**; no paragraph boilerplate  
- [ ] **Consistent style** (casing, quotes, US/UK)  
- [ ] **Links valid**; no placeholders  
- [ ] **CTA clear**; copy fits the design comfortably
